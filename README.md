## Overview :zap:


The task of this assignment was to create a dynamic multiple choice quiz. This quiz consisted of the following features:

1. Expiration Timer

2. Subtracted time for selecting the wrong answer(s)

3. Smooth Transition between Questions

4. A Score Keeper

5. An input for users to enter in there intials and score that will be stored


## Challenges :boom: 

1. Design/Layout - I spent a great deal of time trying to create an acceptable asethic for this quiz. Below I have an image of the inital design, followed up with the active design that I have currently. My goal was to create something unique/original. Also I had an issues trying to implement Bootstrap buttons and badges, and that lead me to incorporate a Bootstrap card design.

2. Functionality - The questions/answers array, the timer/start timer and local storage functions where very challenging. I did alot of trial and error with documentation that I researched along with implementing things we learned from our daily activities. 

Here's a snapshot of some code of the questions functionalities, I was trying to figure out. I felt like I was on the right track, but I became frustrated with not finding the solutions.

3. The biggest challenge was managing my frustration and not navigating accordingly, to get the desired results I wanted. I was going back and forth changing "div" classed and id's from the HTML file and targeting them appropriately on with my JavaScript file. 


## Conclusion :bulb: 

This assignment was very challenging, I did the best I could. To be honest, I would say I was very confused going into this project, which resulted in a lack of confidence to find the solutions I needed. 

I did plan things out the best I could. I created a outline of the project with the questions and some psuedo code outline.
