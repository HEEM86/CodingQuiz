1. Expiration Timer

2. Subtract time for selecting the wrong answer

3. Smooth Transition between Questions

4. A Score Keeper

5. An input for users to enter in there intials and score that will be saved


## Challenges :boom: 

1. Design/Layout - I spent a great deal of time trying to create a acceptable asethic for this quiz. Below I have an image of the inital design, followed up with the active design that I have currently. Although it is incomplete, my goal was to create something unique/original.

2. Functionality - The questions/answers array, the timer and start functions where very challenging. I did alot of trial and error with documentation that I researched along with implementing things we learned from our daily activities. 

Here's some code of the questions functionality I was trying to figure out. I felt like I was on the right track, but I became frustrated with not finding the solutions.

3. The biggest challenge was managing my frustration and not navigating accordingly, to get the desired results I wanted. 


## Conclusion  :bulb: 

This assignment was very challenging, and unfortunately I wasn't able to execute on all of the deliverables for this assignment. To be honest, I would say I was very confused going into this project, which resulted in a lack of confidence to find the solutions I needed. 

I gave it my best shot, I did plan things out the best I could. I created a outline of the project with the questions and some psuedo code outline.
